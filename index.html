		<h1>Project Team 5: Green Space, DS 4200 F19</h1>

		<p><strong>Sarah Chou</strong>, <strong>Megan Lau</strong>, <strong>Hannah Marrow</strong></p>

		<p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>,
			<a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>

		<h1>Motivation</h1>
		<p>Chester Square Park was once a large, grassy park connecting the two sides of Chester Square, but has been separated into two smaller green spaces
				when Massachusettes Avenue was constructed to go straight through Chester Square. Now, the parks are not used quite as often by Chester Square residents
				and pedestrians alike, and the Chester Square Neighbors Association wanted to find ways to possibly enhance the park so that people would get more usage
				and enjoyment out of it. Our study was centered around examining what current residents and pedestrians use the park for, and how often the park is used.
				Ultimately, we decided that making a visualization to address the question of what improvements residents and pedestrians want added to the park would be
				the most useful to the Chester Square Neighbors Association. That way, we can easily present to the Chester Square Neighbors Association what residents and
				pedestrians want to see enhanced in the park, and hopefully making those enhancements will help increase park usage.</p>

		<h1>Visualization</h1>

		<p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>

		<h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

		<p><em>final visualization screenshots (PNG Things_Added_to_the_Parks), design justifications, UI walk-through, 
      and linked presentation slides.</em></p>
      <h3>UI Walkthrough</h3>
      <p>Users can hover over any of the bars in the iso-type bar chart to see what the value of that category is (how many
        responses total for each survey type for that category). When users hover over the iso-type bar chart, the corresponding bars for that 
        same category in the neighboring grouped bar chart get highlighted, thus introducing a linking effect. This helps show how the response 
        types were split for that category. For example, if the user hovers over the "Trees/Plants" iso-type bar, then the "Trees/Plants" bars in the 
        grouped bar chart all get highlighed simultaneously, showing the breakdown of responses. 
        When users hover over any of the bars in the grouped bar chart, the number of responses is also shown in a tool tip, along with the response type.
        We will implement linking to the iso-type bar chart as well, having the corresponding iso-type bar highlight the amount of responses for the 
        individual bar that is hovered over. 
      </p>

		<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
		<p>The data we included was our four different CSV files for the different response types:
				Online Residents, In Person Residents, In Person Pedestrians, and Total Responses. We use the
				Total Responses for our ISO-type bar chart, and the other three individual response types for our grouped bar chart for comparison.
			</p>

		<p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

		<h1>Task Analysis</h1>

		<p>The main task that we wanted to address was the question of "What things do current residents want to see added
       to the green spaces in Chester Square Park?"
        The low level analytic task is to identify, the mid-level search 
        task is to explore, and the high level analyze task is to discover.
			</p>

		<h1>Design Process</h1>

		<p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

		<p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
				Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
				Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


		<h1>Conclusion</h1>

		<p>We have two visualizations: and iso-type bar chart and a grouped bar chart. Our visualizations help answer the question
       "What do people want to see added to the green space?", which was one of the questions in our survey to the residents and park goers of Chester
       Square park.
      The iso-type bar chart shows the total number of responses from each of our participant categories:
       residents we surveyed in person, pedestrians we surveyed in person, and residents we surveyed online. There are icons for each category that 
       serve as a visual aid to what the activity or park addition is. Each of these icons represents one survey response.
       The grouped bar chart shows all three types of survey responses for. 
       The two visualizations are linked through hovering actions: when users hover over one of the iso-type bars, the bars in the corresponding
       category in the grouped bar chart get highlighed. In addition, when users hover of any of the bars individually, or the iso-type bar, 
       a tooltip appears that tells the viewer how many responses there were for that category (in the iso-type chart), or how many responses there were
       for that survey type (in the grouped bar chart), so they do not have to count, thus easing their cognitive load.
