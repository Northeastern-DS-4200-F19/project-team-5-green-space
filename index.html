      <h1>Project Team 5: Green Space, DS 4200 F19</h1>

      <p><strong>Sarah Chou</strong>, <strong>Megan Lau</strong>, <strong>Hannah Marrow</strong></p>

      <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>


      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p><em>Chester Square Park was once a large, grassy park connecting the two sides of Chester Square, but has been separated into two smaller green spaces
        when Massachusettes Avenue was constructed to go straight through Chester Square. Now, the parks are not used quite as often by Chester Square residents
        and pedestrians alike, and the Chester Square Neighbors Association wanted to find ways to possibly enhance the park so that people would get more usage
        and enjoyment out of it. Our study was centered around examining what current residents and pedestrians use the park for, and how often the park is used.
        Ultimately, we decided that making a visualization to address the question of what improvements residents and pedestrians want added to the park would be
        the most useful to the Chester Square Neighbors Association. That way, we can easily present to the Chester Square Neighbors Association what residents and
         pedestrians want to see enhanced in the park, and hopefully making those enhancements will help increase park usage.</em></p>



      <h1>Visualization</h1>

      <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>

    </div>

    <!-- Your visualization here -->
    <div class="vis-holder">
      <!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->
      <!-- Delete all the sample SVG code below after the viewbox to before the closing tag. Populate this part of the SVG with D3.

      svg id="vis-svg" -->
      <!-- <svg>

      Don't delete the closing tag! -->
      <!-- </svg> -->

      <h1>Demo Video</h1>

      <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>

      <video controls width="100%">
        <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
         a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
      </video>

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

      <p><em>final visualization screenshots (PNG imThings_Added_to_the_Parks), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em>The data we included was our 4 different CSVs for the different response types:
        Online Residents, In Person Residents, In Person Pedestrians, and Total Responses. We are planning on using the
        Total Responses for our ISO-type bar chart, and the other 3 individual response types for our grouped bar chart for comparison.
      </em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p><em>The main task that we wanted to address was the question of "What things do current residents want to see added to the green spaces in Chester Square Park?"
        The low level analytic task is to identify, the mid-level search task is to explore, and the high level analyze task is to discover.
      </em></p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
      Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
      Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p><em>For now, we have a grouped bar chart as our first visualization which shows all three types of survey responses for
        the question "What do people want to see added to the green space?". We will add our iso-type bar chart in the future
        that has the total number of responses for each category, with icons for each category that show what the activity or park addition is.
        There will be brushing and linking involved between the two visualizations.
