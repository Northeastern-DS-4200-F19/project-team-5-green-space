		<h1>Project Team 5: Green Space, DS 4200 F19</h1>

		<p><strong>Sarah Chou</strong>, <strong>Megan Lau</strong>, <strong>Hannah Marrow</strong></p>

		<p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS
				4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a
				href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>,

		<h1>Motivation</h1>

		<img src="images/park.jpg" alt="chester park" style="width:90%">

		<p>Chester Square Park was once a large, grassy park connecting the two sides of Chester Square, but has been
			separated into two smaller green spaces
			when Massachusettes Avenue was constructed to go straight through Chester Square. Now, the parks are not
			used quite as often by Chester Square residents
			and pedestrians alike, and the Chester Square Neighbors Association wanted to find ways to possibly enhance
			the park so that people would get more usage
			and enjoyment out of it. </p>

		<p>Our study was centered around examining what current residents and pedestrians use
			the park for, and how often the park is used.
			Ultimately, we decided that making a visualization to address the question of what improvements residents
			and pedestrians want added to the park would be
			the most useful to the Chester Square Neighbors Association. That way, we can easily present to the Chester
			Square Neighbors Association what residents and
			pedestrians want to see enhanced in the park, and hopefully making those enhancements will help increase
			park usage.</p>

		<h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
		<h3>UI Walkthrough</h3>
		<p>Users can hover over any of the bars in the iso-type bar chart to see what the value of that category is (how
			many
			responses total for each survey type for that category). When users hover over the iso-type bar chart, the
			corresponding bars for that
			same category in the neighboring grouped bar chart get highlighted, thus introducing a linking effect. This
			helps show how the response
			types were split for that category. For example, if the user hovers over the "Trees/Plants" iso-type bar,
			then the "Trees/Plants" bars in the
			grouped bar chart all get highlighed simultaneously, showing the breakdown of responses.
		</p>
		<p>
			When users hover over any of the bars in the grouped bar chart, the number of responses is also shown in a
			tool tip, along with the response type.
			We will implement linking to the iso-type bar chart as well, having the corresponding iso-type bar highlight
			the amount of responses for the
			individual bar that is hovered over.
		</p>

		<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
		<p>The data we included is derived from four different CSV files for the different our response types:
			Online Residents, In Person Residents, In Person Pedestrians, and Total Responses. The Online Residents data
			indicates the data we collected from responses to an
			online survey sent out by Carol Blair to residents of Chester Square. The In Person Residents data indicates
			the data we collected from going to Chester Park ourselves
			and asking Chester Square residents in person to answer the same questions from the online survey. The In
			Person Pedestrians data indicates the data we collected from going
			to Chester Park and asking pedestrians walking through the park to answer the same questions from the online
			survey. Total responses is the aggregation of those three groups.
			We used the Total Responses data for our ISO-type bar chart, and the other three individual response types
			data for our grouped bar chart for comparison.
		</p>

		<h1>Task Analysis</h1>

		<p>The main task that we wanted to address was the question of "What things do current residents want to see
			added
			to the green spaces in Chester Square Park?" The low level analytic task is to identify, the mid-level
			search task is to explore, and the high level analyze task is to discover.
		</p>

		<h1>Design Process</h1>

		<p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column">
				<img src="images/sketch1.png" alt="sketch 1" style="width:90%">
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<img src="images/sketch2.png" alt="sketch 2" style="width:90%">
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<img src="images/sketch3.png" alt="sketch 3" style="width:90%">
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>Ultimately, we decided that using a single bar chart with a juxtaposing grouped bar chart would be the most
			effective way to display the answer to our main question of
			"what do people want to see added to Chester Park?" It is effective because both visualizations make use of
			the vertical spatial position channel in order to encode the quantity
			of people who chose each enhancement as the one that they want to see in the park. This makes it really easy
			for the user to quickly and effectively encode the data upon first glance,
			as they can easily tell that the highest bar is the enhancement that the majority of people said that they
			would like to see in the park. We made the single bar chart an isotype bar
			chart because the pictures made the visualization and little more fun and engaging, and it is helpful that
			the number of pictures corresponds to the number of responses, so that the
			user can count them to get an exact number if they want, rather than trying to guess by following the top of
			the bar to the y axis on the left, which is especially hard to do with
			pictures (but we also added details on demand for this reason so that viewers do not have to manually count,
			but they could if they wanted to).
		</p>
		<p>
			We also decided to use a grouped bar
			chart because we had three different groups that we surveyed, so breaking the results from the isotype bar
			chart down into their respective groups allowed for the user to get even
			more insight about what kinds of enhancements people want to see added to the park. The grouped bar chart
			uses the same vertical spatial encoding that is easy for the user to
			understand. It also uses color encoding which is a valuable tool because it allows viewers to easily discern
			the different groups. We thought these visualizations would be of great
			use to the Chester Square Neighbors because not only can they get a high level idea of what things people
			want to see added and enhanced in Chester Park, they can also see how that
			breakdown looks in terms of pedestrians and residents, and even further in terms of residents who responded
			to an online survey and residents who were actually using the park. That
			way, if they want to target one specific group, this tool allows them to do so.
		</p>


		<h1>Conclusion</h1>

		<p>We have created two data visualizations: an iso-type bar chart and a grouped bar chart. Our visualizations
			help answer the
			question
			"What do people want to see added to the green space?", which was one of the questions in our survey to the
			residents and park goers of Chester
			Square Park.
			The iso-type bar chart shows the total number of responses from each of our participant categories:
			residents we surveyed in person, pedestrians we surveyed in person, and residents we surveyed online. There
			are icons for each category that
			serve as a visual aid to what the activity or park addition is. Each of these icons represents one survey
			response.
			The grouped bar chart shows the response counts of all three types of survey responses.
		</p>
		<p>
			The two visualizations are linked through hovering actions: when users hover over one of the iso-type bars,
			the bars in the corresponding
			category in the grouped bar chart get highlighed. Similarly, when users hover of any of the bars in the
			grouped bar
			chart, the corresponding bar for that response gets highlighted in the iso-graph. In addition, when users
			hover any of the bars
			individually, or any of the iso-type bar,
			a tooltip appears that tells the viewer how many responses there were for that category (in the iso-type
			chart), or how many responses there were
			for that survey type (in the grouped bar chart), so they do not have to count, thus easing their cognitive
			load.
